## Backing up Ubuntu

In the past I have been using Clonezilla to backup my Ubuntu installation, but I wasn't happy with it. It took too long, I was not being productive, and overall the need create a bootable device using the Clonezilla ISO was not fun for me. Furthermore restoring such a backup was equally problematic. Let's face it:

**I want to backup my files, not dealing with filesystem problems!**

That's why I decided to look for a backup solution, which would backup my systems settings, installed data, packages, themes etc.. I wanted to be able to work, while backing up my system in the background. So I started to search and stumbled upon [Aptik](https://github.com/teejee2008/aptik "Aptik")

> Aptik is a tool for migrating settings and data from one Linux installation to another. It can be used while re-installing the operating system, and when moving to next release of a Linux distribution.

Sounds great!

Fortunately installing Aptik is **pretty easy:**

```shell
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aptik aptik-gtk
```

The way Aptik works is it backups basically all your options, settings, themes, wallpapers, the _home directory_ and so on. These are the key points to consider when **backing up & restoring** your system:

- can be used while re-installing the operating system or moving to next release of a Linux distribution.
- no encrypted backups, so encrypt your drive you backup to instead!
- restore operation should be run on a fresh Linux installation. 
- can be run on an existing system but this is not recommended
- supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and their derivatives, but not all features are included ein every derivative
- only migrate between same architecture, e.g. 32bit to 32bit 

> Aptik should only be used to migrate between two installations of same distribution. For example, you can migrate from Fedora 24 to Fedora 25, or from Ubuntu 17.04 to Ubuntu 17.10, but not from Fedora to Ubuntu.




Aptik should only be used to migrate between two installations of same architecture. For example, you can migrate from 32-bit to 32-bit system, or from 64-bit to 64-bit system, but not from 32-bit to 64-bit. This is because package names and repositories vary between different architecures and cannot be migrated.
